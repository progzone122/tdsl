# I Want to Contribute!

Read the "Criteria" section and answer these questions. If you answer "Yes" to even one question, this full-of-shit person definitely needs to be punished by adding them to our Hall of Shame!

## Criteria
- Did you waste your time because of a resource created by a half-baked product, and it turned out to be pure misinformation?
- Does the resource look like a scam with a single universal guide, even for your fucking Chinese Tetris?
- Is the resource simply stealing content from other popular sites word-for-word without crediting the source?
- Was the text COMPLETELY generated by AI, and this brainless asshole didnâ€™t even bother to check if the article/instruction actually works?

## Adding a New Domain to the List
Special scripts have been developed to make this process easier.
1. Install Python (if it's not installed)
2. Add the domain
    ```shell
    python scripts/newdomain.py google.com
    ```
3. Generate the rules
    ```shell
    python scripts/rulegen.py
    ```
4. **Open a pull request**, thoroughly explaining why this domain deserves to be on this list and providing evidence.

> ATTENTION!<br /> 
> Rule: 1 domain == 1 pull request

### What's next?
The Owner/Admins of the repository will review your pull request, and if everything checks out, the domain will be added to the list. A link to the pull request will be added in the comments (or in the source argument).
